# Independent-Projects
A repository where each directory is an independent project. Mostly Proof of Concepts.

At the moment, there is just one application in here - an Automated Model Deployment tool developed in RShiny. It was conceived and built in my own time as a cheap alternative to 'Data Robot'. Specifically, the user loaded a csv file and a selection of models were built against the data set and ranked. The first column was assumed to be the dependent variable the user was trying to target. Using a radio button, the user could flit between two modes: 'Predicton', if the regressand was continuous, and 'Classification', if binary. Once a user chose a model (by clicking on it) it was possible to review the sumamry statistics via the 'Model Summary' and 'Diagnostic Model Plots' tabs. These worked for the basic Least Squares Regression model (using the glm function), but some work was still needed for the others (Best_Subset, Ridge and Lasso). Extending the application to include more models is easy enough. The motivation for adopting RShiny was twofold: I had recently completed a lengthy online course in Data Science in R, which had a module on building Data Products in RShiny, so it was all still fresh in my head. Secondly, it was imperative the models be savable in the RDS format (due to a problem at work, which I hoped this could solve).

For those not familiar with RShiny, open the UI or Server files in RStudio and click RunApp.
